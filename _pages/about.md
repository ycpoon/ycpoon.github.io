![Michigan](/images/michigan.jpg){: .align-right width="200px"}
I am an incoming final year Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. 

I am focused and specialized in 
- *Computer Architecture* 📲
- *Digital System & Logic Design* 🧠
- *VLSI & Chip Design* 🖥️
- *Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL* 🧑‍💻

I have several years of internship and working experience from the Efinix Inc, University of Michigan Solar Car Team and Aerodyne Group, working in RTL design verification, post-silicon validation, firmware engineering roles and tech research roles. Academically, I have achieved a 3.69 GPA over my tertiary education, completing high-level computer engineering courses including Computer Architecture, Integrated Circuits & VLSI, GPU Programming, Logic Design, Circuit Analysis, Data Structures and Algorithms, and many more.

I am currently searching for internship and full-time opportunities to further advance my engineering knowledge and gain more practical experience in the field.

My Passion 🔥
======

Growing up, I was always fascinated by computers and technology, curious about how these devices worked and were designed. That curiosity naturally led me to pursue computer engineering and sparked a deep passion for digital logic design and computer architecture. Over time, I’ve explored this field through hands-on projects ranging from building a MIPS R10K-style out-of-order processor from scratch to designing a four function calculator on Altera FPGA. I find hardware design both intellectually challenging and incredibly rewarding, and I particularly enjoy solving complex hardware problems while pushing the limits of performance through RTL design. This passion has driven me to develop my own IP core library by redesigning soft IP cores in SystemVerilog for improved performance and functionality. These projects have continue to fuel my aspiration to one day contribute to groundbreaking and revolutionary ASIC/FPGA/CPU designs. *Check out the personal project page for more details on my projects*
