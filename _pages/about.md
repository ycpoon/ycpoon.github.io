![Michigan](/images/michigan.jpg){: .align-right width="200px"}
I am a 3rd year Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. 

I am focused and specialized in 
- *Embedded Systems* 📲
- *VLSI & Chips Design* 🖥️
- *Low-Level VHDL Programming* 🧑‍💻

I have several years of internship and working experience from the University of Michigan Solar Car Team and Aerodyne Group, working in firmware engineering roles and tech research roles. Academically, I have achieved a 3.86 GPA from the University of Michigan, completing high-level computer engineering courses including Intro to VLSI, Logic Design, Circuit Analysis, Data Structures and Algorithms, and many more.

I am currently searching for internship opportunities to further advance my engineering knowledge and gain more practical experience in the field.


My Passion
======

Born in the 2000s,  I have been blessed to witness the advancement of technology from Nokia phones to iPhones. I always wonder, how did Bell invent the first-ever telephone? How did Steve Jobs design the first-ever iPhone? And, how does it lead us to today, where we have phones with hundreds of functions, all in that tiny device? These questions that have been lingering around my head are what drove me to pursue the major of **computer engineering**.

I have always been passionate about **tech**. I significantly enjoy **building devices** and **playing around with Arduino**. One of my proudest projects is a $80 computer that I built using simple Rasberry Pi as an initiative to provide underprivileged children with access to computers.
